AccelerationFilter
==================

Acceleration Filter allows the user to view the outputs from multiple low-pass filters in real-time. This makes it easy to compare the performance of different low-pass filters.

Explore the effects of low-pass filters on acceleration sensors!

Discover how low-pass filters work on acceleration sensors by viewing the outputs in real-time. Acceleration Filter runs multiple low-pass filters at once so you can compare the results from a single input quickly and easily. The output from the filters is plotted with a line graph while the noise is plotted with a bar graph. The user can select if the scaling factor, alpha, is determine dynamically or the user can set alpha to a static value. This allows user to explore a large number of filter settings to quickly determine what is best for their application. Perfect for visualizing the effect of low-pass filters on digital signals. You can even log the output to an external .csv file.

Features:

• Graph acceleration in real-time
• View signal noise in real-time
• Compare multiple low-pass filter configurations simultaneously
• Define how the low-pass filter calculates alpha, or, set alpha to a static value
• Log filter outputs to an external .csv file
