Acceleration Filter is an open source code example and working Android application intended to allow users to explore the use of digital low-pass filters and mean filters on the devices acceleration sensor. A low-pass filter is a filter that passes low-frequency signals and attenuates signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency. The low-pass filter can be used to reduce the noise on sensor signals, or can be used in alternative methods such as estimating linear acceleration. 

Acceleration Filter allows the user to view the outputs from multiple low-pass filters in real-time. This makes it easy to compare the performance of different low-pass filters. Along with the low-pass filters, a mean averaging method is also available to compare the relative performance of the low-pass filters to simple mean averaging filters. The user can select if the low-pass filter scaling factor, alpha, is determine dynamically based on a time constant and the update frequency of the sensor... or the user can set alpha to a static value. This allows user to explore a large number of filter settings to quickly determine what is best for their application. Perfect for visualizing the effect of low-pass filters on digital signals. You can even log the output to an external .csv file.

Features:

* Plot the raw acceleration and the filtered acceleration in real-time
* Select what filters and axes you want to plot
* Log the raw acceleration and filtered acceleration to a .CSV file
* View the noise of the raw acceleration and filtered acceleration in real-time
* Define the parameters of the low-pass filters and mean filters
* Compare the performance of multiple low-pass filters to the mean filters and raw acceleration
